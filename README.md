# CookBookRS

This is a rewrite in rust of my initial attempt at this project in
[golang](https://github.com/sww1235/CookBook)

This is a recipe database and viewer designed to easily store recipes, help
generate shopping lists and meal recommendations, and eventually connect to a
kitchen inventory database to track items in your pantry and allow you to cook
with what you have.
